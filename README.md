============

Implementation of Shor's algorithm in Python 3.X. Shor's algorithm performs integer factorization on a quantum computer, which can break many asymmetric (public/private key) encryption systems such as RSA or Diffieâ€“Hellman. This implementation simulates a quantum circuit using state vectors and unitary mappings.  For more information, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor's_algorithm

See python shors.py --help for details on how to use the simulation.
